## Principles for accessible design
Those are approaches that can help anticipate, include, and respond to the needs of individuals. They're considerations for design development, collaboration, and co-creation that encourage inclusive and equitable outcomes.
## Honor individuals
==Universal default experiences rarely meet everyone's needs==. Introducing customizable features in a default experience allows room for individual adaptation. Honoring thee shifting needs of any person can mean giving more freedom to choose things for themselves.

Because a person's experience throughout their day, or year, or life can continue to change, it helps to support varying preferences and choices that allow individuals to address how their changing conditions, individual knowledge, and varying needs are met.
## Learn before, not after
==Before defining solutions, **invest time in understanding the needs of users with a wide range of abilities and life experiences**.== Formal and informal research can open new ways of thinking, reduce biases, and encourage creative ways to make access available, especially to chose who fall outside prevailing norms.

Accessible design processes anticipate as many potencial product or experience outcomes as possible upfront. When design problem arise, the exploration of outcomes can be used as a research foundation for learning and recovering thoughtfully.
## Requirements as starting point
The minimum requirements established by WCAG support specific human needs. Designing with accessibility standards is a creative opportunity to expand and improve the application of requirements that improve human relationships with technology.

History has shown that features originating from responses to specific access needs (dark mode, text-to-speech, speech-to-text) are as opportunities, rather than constraints, has been shown to lead to solutions that ultimately serve many.
