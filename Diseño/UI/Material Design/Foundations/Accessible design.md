## Assistive technology
Assistive technology helps increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities. People can live more independently by engaging with technology through devices like keyboards, screen readers, and braille display, as well as tracking input, magnifiers, and voice input.

### Common forms of assistive technologies

#### Keyboard
Hardware of software *directional controllers* such as keyboards, a D-pad, or trackball allow users to jump from selection to selection in a linear fashion.
### Screen readers
A screen reader is a software program that uses either a braille display or reads text aloud, such as Google's screen reader, TalkBack. People with vision impairments, experiencing difficulty reading, or who temporarily can't read might use a screen reader. Screen readers verbalize visible content and read it aloud. Paragraph and button text, as well as hidden content like alternative text for icons and headings, are identified by the program. This content can be labeled to optimize the experience for those who use screen rea<u></u>ders or experience a text-only version of your UI.
#### Switch input
Switches scan the items on your screen, highlighting each item in turn, until you make a selection. Switch Access lets you interact with your Android device using one or more switches instead of the touchscreen.
### Hierarchy
When navigation is easy, users understand where they are in your app and whatâ€™s important. To emphasize which information is important, multiple visual and textual cues like color, shape, text, and motion add clarity.
#### Types of feedback
Visual feedback (such as labels, colors, and icons) and touch feedback show users what is available in the UI.
#### Navigation
Navigation can have clear task flows with minimal steps, easy-to-locate controls and clear labeling.
Focus control with keyboard can be implemented for frequently used tasks.

Every added button, image, and line of text increases the complexity of a UI. You can simplify how your UI is understood by using:
- Clearly visible elements
- Sufficient contrast and size
- A clear hierarchy of importance
- Key information that is discernable at a glance

To convey an item's relative level of importance:
- Place important actions at the top or bottom of the screen (reachable with shortcuts)
- Place related items of a similar hierarchy next to each other
### Visual hierarchy
To enable thee screen reader to read out content in the intended order, it's important for designer to collaborate with developers - both for writing out the HTML in the correct order, and understanding  how screen readers will interpret designs.

While CSS determines the layout and appearance of a page, screen readers rely on the top-down structure of HTML on any platform (mobile or web).
