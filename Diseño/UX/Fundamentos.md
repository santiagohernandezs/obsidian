# UXD Definition

UX design aims at conceiving the best riding experience ever!

UX Design is all about innovation; in the same way, UI design is all about interfaces.
Innovation and innovators change how we live.

UX Design delivers user-centred innovation, meaning that innovation depends on how humans use technology instead of conceiving innovative technology. 

There are three types of innovations: incremental, radical and disruptive.

Aarron Walter, in his book "Designing for Emotion", has proposed a UX pyramid echoing Maslow's famous hierarchy of human needs. Walter points out that that the highest UX needs (pleasure, meaning) can only be achieved if the product has a strong foundation in usability and basic functionality.

We have remodelled the pyramid in a tree-like appearance: the trunk representing foundational user needs related to UI design, and the foliage fulfilling the user needs associated to the subjective experience related to UX design.

# Types of Innovation
-   Incremental Innovation:	
	-   Solves an issue which everyone is aware of;
	-  Is needed for companies to keep or improve their market share.
-    Radical Innovation:
	-   Answers to untapped needs, i.e. issues we tolerate / needs we haven’t identified yet;
	-  Technology-driven technology, by innovating or recycling technologies in new ways;
	-   Changes the industry.
-    Disruptive Innovation:
	-   Strategy to be able to get into an extremely complex market filled with large players;
	-   Only way to be part of the game is to create a new market to eventually disrupt an existing market;
	- Also answers to untapped needs.

## Incremental Innovation 
Incremental innovation is a series of small improvements applied to a product, service, process, or method.

### Pros
-   As you streamline elements and update your process, the user experience will be more fluid, contemporary and pleasant, possibly responding to customer comments and suggestions;
-   Because of its incremental nature, change, and therefore the transition, can be done rather easily; 
-   It improves growth with minimal risk, by making modest changes in technology to existing platforms, services and products;
-   It extends the life of a product or service while remaining competitive in a specific market.
### Cons
-   First, standard limits such as time, money, budget, and possible change could potentially deter companies;
-   Sometimes, a product’s life is at the point where there is no longer any opportunity for minor changes and faces major uphaul or slow decline.

## **Radical Innovation**
Radical innovation is a major technological breakthrough that transforms the industry, spinning off existing technology with a variation that is entirely new.

### Pros
-   Radical innovation is driven by consumer adoption. Since it is addressing users’ needs, adoption should follow easily.
### Cons
-   The organization's capacity to support new products and potentially new processes. This is why start-ups are better positioned to bring radically innovative products and services than larger companies with well-established processes and structures.
-   Uncertainty: An organization may be the first one to identify this need, but what if others have known about it for some time and yet, have not acted upon it? Is it because of the complexity of the initiative? Or is there no real interest in fulfilling this need? Moreover, if this need has not already been identified by other companies, then you must act quickly…and acting quickly is also risky.

## **Disruptive Innovation** 
Disruptive innovation is, as defined by Clayton Christensen, an innovation that originates in a low-end or a new market. It **creates a new market and eventually disrupts an existing market**, displacing established market-leading companies and products.

### Pros
-   If you are able to capture such innovation, you will establish and direct the rules of the market… at least for a while.
### Cons
-   Because it challenges internal and external processes, it is best carried out by companies that have more agility in the face of change.

# Co-Design
Co-Design is the act of design something by working with a someone or with a team.

**UXD Is collaborative**

## Co-Design Outputs
1. Design Feedback and Suggestions.
2. A better understanding of mental models.

## Rules of Co-Design
1. Create a safe space that facilitate creativity.
	1. To mark territories
	2. To stablish who is in charge.
2. Copyright free.
3. Interactive and share-data driven process.
4. Hierarchy free.

## Purpose of having rules for Co-Design
- Foster Discussion.
- Easy for external users to participate.
- Do not judge, nor take contribution at face value.
- Encourage external participants to flesh out their ideas.
- Shared clarity of purpose.
- Comprehensive inclusion of people.

# Mental Models, Insights & Empathy
A mental model is an internal representation of an external reality.

When we design new products or services, we need to consider **how they may satisfy, affect, change, or fit the user's world**.

## Insights
It's an accurate and deep intuitive understanding of something that we get from "connection the dots".
## Empathy
It's the ability to feel someone's emotions. It's a tool and it is used to take action and give us ideas.
