Remember that the main question you are trying to answer is: **"What is the experience we’re creating and what’s the enduring memory we’re hoping to create?"**.

# kick-off meeting

The **objectives** of a Kick-Off Meeting are to:
1.  Define the project and its boundaries;
2.  Reveal underlying assumptions;
3.  Identify a realistic roadmap to the project;  
4.  Build a consensus between all the parties involved in the Project Brief.

**Kick-Off Meeting Structure**

-   Introduction
-   Present the project's executive summary.
-   Present and discuss scope and deliverables: What are the project’s boundaries? What are the parameters of the deliverables (time, format, audience…).
-   Present the roles and responsibilities; again state clear expectations.
-   State timelines, communication and meeting plans.
-   Discuss about who we are building this solution for.
# Personas
A persona is a representation of a user or customer, and can be used to better understand and empathize with that user or customer. By understanding the persona, you can better understand the user’s needs and wants, and create a more user-friendly interface.

# Guerrilla Research Protocol
Here are basic guidelines on how to conduct a guerrilla research protocol.
1.  Prepare interview protocol;
2.  Prepare interview guide using an Empathy Map;
3.  Recruit participants;
4.  Conduct guerrilla interview;
5.  Debrief each interview immediately returning to the Empathy Map;
6.  Once all interviews are done, start the analysis process;
7.  Finish the analysis process with a teammate or a friendly colleague.
We put together a [deck of slides briefly going over these 7 points](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/48070e4d1761f64fbde2898f46e3f12d/asset-v1:HECMontrealX+UXe03x.1+2T2022+type@asset+block/HEC-MOOC3-GuerrillaReseachAnyone.pdf).

The easiest way to structure an interview (through the interview guide) is to use an Empathy Map. An empathy map is a unique tool: we rely heavily on it, but it seldom finds its way into client deliverables. It is a tool internal to the design team.
